                Initiating a quality enhancement program for software testing with Rapd begins by conducting a
                thorough review of your existing test processes, known as a Test Process Review. This
                comprehensive assessment covers various critical aspects, including test policies, strategies,
                and methodologies; risk analysis and management related to the product; design techniques
                for testing; organization and expertise of the test team; engagement and cooperation among
                stakeholders; setup of test environments; usage of metrics and tools for efficiency;
                communication within the team and progress tracking; and the incorporation of automated
                processes. The goal is to create a detailed overview of your current testing landscape.
